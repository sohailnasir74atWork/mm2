/**
 * Cloud Function: Return expired boosted trades to the normal feed
 *
 * Runs hourly. Finds trades whose boost has elapsed (`isFeatured` is still
 * true but `featuredUntil` is in the past) and flips `isFeatured` back to
 * false.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * Boosting sets isFeatured=true and featuredUntil=+12h, but nothing ever set
 * isFeatured back. The feed runs two queries:
 *
 *   featured  →  isFeatured == true  AND featuredUntil > now
 *   normal    →  isFeatured == false
 *
 * Once featuredUntil passes, an expired trade matches NEITHER — it is no
 * longer featured, but it is not "normal" either. It disappeared from the app
 * completely and stayed invisible until cleanupOldTrades deleted it at 7 days.
 *
 * So boosting actively COST the owner visibility: 12 hours at the top, then
 * roughly six days of being invisible, versus seven normal days if they had
 * never boosted at all. With the rewarded-ad boost pushing far more trades
 * through this path, that goes from rare to routine.
 *
 * Hourly rather than daily: a trade should rejoin the feed shortly after its
 * boost ends, not at the next nightly sweep. The query is indexed and matches
 * only the handful of trades that expired in the last hour, so the read cost
 * is negligible.
 *
 * INDEX
 * Served by the existing composite (isFeatured ASC, featuredUntil DESC) in
 * firestore.indexes.json — Firestore uses a composite index in either
 * direction, so no new index is needed. Verified 2026-09-16.
 *
 * Deployment:
 * firebase deploy --only functions:expireFeaturedTrades
